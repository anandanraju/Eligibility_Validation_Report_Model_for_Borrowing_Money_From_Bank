## Eligibility_Validation_Report_Model_for_Borrowing_Money_From_Bank
## Introduction

* In simple terms, borrowing money from a bank is simply the same as obtaining a loan.

* **A Loan is the sum of money that you borrow from the bank or lending financial institution in order to meet needs. These needs could result from planned or unplanned events, and by borrowing, you incur a debt that you have to pay within the agreed duration on your contract.**
